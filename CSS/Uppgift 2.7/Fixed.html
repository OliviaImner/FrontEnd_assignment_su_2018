                <p> The Kingdom of Kongo (Kongo: Kongo dya Ntotila or Wene wa Kongo; Portuguese: Reino do Congo) was an African kingdom     located in west central Africa in what is now northern Angola, Cabinda, the Republic of the Congo, the western          portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as the southernmost part of Gabon. At its greatest             extent, it reached from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Kwango River in the east, and from the Congo River      in the north to the Kwanza River in the south. The kingdom consisted of several core provinces ruled by the           Manikongo, the Portuguese version of the Kongo title 'Mwene Kongo', meaning lord or ruler of the Kongo kingdom, but     its sphere of influence extended to neighbouring kingdoms, such as Ngoyo, Kakongo, Ndongo and Matamba.

                        From c. 1390 to 1891 it was mostly an independent state. From 1891 to 1914 it was a vassal state of the Kingdom of Portugal.[citation needed] In 1914, the titular monarchy was forcibly abolished, following Portuguese victory against a Kongo revolt. The remaining territories of the kingdom were assimilated into the colony of Angola. The modern-day Bundu dia Kongo sect favors reviving the kingdom through secession from Angola, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Gabon.

                    <p>Verbal traditions about the early history of the country were set in writing for the first time in the late 16th century, and the most comprehensive were recorded in the mid-seventeenth century, including those written by the Italian Capuchin missionary Giovanni Cavazzi da Montecuccolo. More detailed research in modern oral traditions, initially conducted in the early 20th century by Redemptorist missionaries like Jean Cuvelier and Joseph de Munck do not appear to relate to the very early period.</p>
